This project boilerplate really doesn't need a license.
Do whatever you want with it.
If you put in hundreds of hours of work and converted it into a major framework
then you have the right to choose what to do with the code.
Customize this boilerplate to suit your needs and make it your own.
May it serve you well.
Use at your own risk (not that it should cause you any harm).
Have fun making cool things with Sinatra.
